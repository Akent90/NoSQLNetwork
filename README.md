## Description

NoSQLNetwork is a complete back-end API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This app uses Express.js for RESTful API routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

Here is a video recording of the API endpoints being tested in Insomnia:
